In order to run Simuphonics, the user must download all necessary libraries along with a compatible version of Python. 
These libraries include: Numpy, Tensorflow, Scipy, and Kivy. All other libraries utilized come with Python itself. 
Afterwards, the user must download the two scripts: “DCGANMODEL.py” and “DCGAN.py.” 
In order to compile these two scripts, the user must put them in the same directory, along with the files “dogbarkdemo.wav,” “generateddemo.wav,” and “testbg6.jpg.” 
All of these files will be provided in the References Section. After downloading all required files and libraries, the user then runs “py DCGAN.py” or the equivalent (depending on python version) in the command prompt. 
The user may also compile “DCGAN.py” using an IDE such as Visual Studio, which will also run the application.
